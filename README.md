## Description

termie (formerly tmeta) is a wrapper for tmux that supports
sending and receiving data to/from tmux panes.

Anything typed into the bottom pane is sent to the top one, but
lines that start with a backslash are commands for `termie`.
You can type `\help` to see all possible commands.

(To send a literal leading backslash, either start with a
space or start with a double backslash.)

## Why

Because you get:

- an uncluttered view of your commands separate from the output
- a local history for commands that are run remotely
- readline interface independent of the remote console
- scripting support for programs that require a TTY
- macros
- the ability to monitor or capture output
- other `expect`-like functionality
- controlled copy-and-paste operations into remote sessions

## Quick start

See below for installation.

There are a few different ways to start `termie`.

1. Start `tmux` yourself, then have `termie` split a window and
start up in its own pane:
   ```
   $ tmux
   $ termie
   ```

2. Let `termie` start tmux for you:
  ```
  $ termie
  ```

3. Run a termie script.  This will split and run in another pane.
   ```
   $ tmux
   $ termie script.termie
   ```

I use the `.termie` suffix for my `termie` scripts.  If you do too, you
might like this [vim syntax file](syntax/termie.vim).

## What do I use it with

termie plays well with REPLs, or any console based
application that uses a tty.  For instance, docker, rails
console, interactive ruby shell, the python debugger, the
jupyter console, psql, mysql, regular ssh sessions, local
terminal sessions, whatever

## More documentation

Please see the [documentation](https://github.com/bduggan/tmeta/blob/master/doc.md) for a complete list of commands.

## Examples

  Show a list of commands.
  ```
  > \help
  ```

  Run `date` every 5 seconds until the output contains `02`
  ```
  > date
  > \repeat
  > \await 02
  ```

  Within a debugger session, send `next` every 2 seconds.
  ```
  > next
  > \repeat 2
  ```

  Search the command history for the last occurrence of 'User' using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
  (readline command history works too)
  ```
  > \find User
  ```

  Search the output for "http"
  ```
  > \grep http
  ```

  Send a local file named `bigfile.rb` to a remote rails console
  ```
  > \send bigfile.rb
  ```

  Same thing, but throttle the copy-paste operation, sending 1 line per second:
  ```
  > \delay 1
  > \send bigfile.rb
  ```

  Similar, but send it to an ssh console by first tarring and base64 encoding
  and not echoing stdout, and note that 'something' can also be a directory:
  ```
  > \xfer something
  ```

  Run a command locally, sending each line of output to the remote console:
  ```
  > \do echo date
  ```

  Run a shell snippet locally, sending each line of output to the remote console:
  ```
  > \dosh for i in `seq 5`; do echo "ping host-$i"; done
  ```

  Start printing the numbers 1 through 100, one per second, but send a ctrl-c
  when the number 10 is printed:
  ```
  > \enq \stop
  queue is now : \stop
  > for i in `seq 100`; do echo $i; sleep 1; done
  # .. starts running in other pane ...
  > \await 10
  Waiting for "10"
  Then I will send:
  \stop
  Done: saw "10"
  starting enqueued command: \stop
  ```

  Add an alias `cat` which cats a local file
  ```
  \alias cat \shell cat
  ```

  Show a local file (do not send it to the other pane) using the above alias
  ```
  \cat myfile
  ```

  Edit a file named session.rb, in ~/.termie/scripts
  ```
  \edit session.rb
  ```

  After running the above, add this to session.rb:
  ```
  irb

  \expect irb(main):001:0>

  "hello world"

  \expect irb(main):002:0>

  exit
  ```

  Now running
  ```
  \run session.rb
  ```

  will start the interactive ruby console (irb) and the following
  session should take place on the top panel:

  ```
  $ irb
  irb(main):001:0> "hello world"
  => "hello world"
  irb(main):002:0> exit
  $
  ```

## Installation

Prerequisites: fzf, tmux, libreadline, raku and a few modules

On OS/X
```
brew install fzf
brew install tmux
brew install rakudo
zef install https://github.com/bduggan/termie.git
```

You can also install raku with [rakubrew](https://rakubrew.org)
and then use `zef` to install termie.
